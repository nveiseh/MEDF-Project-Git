1. Create Project Folder, with initial app inside of the same name
Do this automatically by Aptana, or from the command line: django-admin.py startproject MEDF

2. Start the server to verify it is working:
python manage.py runserver
Check server status, but going through webbrowser on http://127.0.0.1:8000/
python manage.py runserver 8080
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

3. Setting up NEW APP 
Start your first app by running python manage.py startapp [appname].
This may be already done, but should be redone with each new app

4. Setting up DATABASE
If you plan to use a database, edit the DATABASES setting in MEDF/settings.py.
Need to specify ENGINE and NAME:         
'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3', # Add 'postgresql_psycopg2', 'mysql', 'sqlite3' or 'oracle'.
'NAME': '/Users/nimave/Desktop/SkyDrive/Aptana/MEDF_Project_Git/sqlite.db',                   
Or, can use default path of default value, os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),

For MySQL: Make sure you’ve created a database by this point. Do that with “CREATE DATABASE database_name;” 
within your database’s interactive prompt.If you’re using SQLite, you don’t need to create anything beforehand - 
the database file will be created automatically when it is needed.

Check Installed Apps, that govern DB:

Run the database by the following command: python manage.py syncdb
