1. Create Project Folder, with initial app inside of the same name
Do this automatically by Aptana, or from the command line: django-admin.py startproject MEDF

2. Start the server to verify it is working:
python manage.py runserver
Check server status, but going through webbrowser on http://127.0.0.1:8000/
python manage.py runserver 8080
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

3. Setting up NEW APP 
Start your first app by running python manage.py startapp [appname].
This may be already done, but should be redone with each new app

4. Setting up DATABASE
If you plan to use a database, edit the DATABASES setting in MEDF/settings.py.
