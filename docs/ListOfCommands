To start DB:
python manage.py syncdb


To create your app, make sure you’re in the same directory as manage.py and type this command:
python manage.py startapp polls

Edit the polls/models.py file so it looks like this:
from django.db import models

class Poll(models.Model):
    question = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    pub_date = models.DateTimeField('date published')

class Choice(models.Model):
    poll = models.ForeignKey(Poll)
    choice_text = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    votes = models.IntegerField(default=0)

Each class is a new database, and each field under the class is a field in that database.

To install the App in the db:
Edit the mysite/settings.py file again, and change the INSTALLED_APPS setting to include the string 'polls'. So it’ll look like this:
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'polls',
)
Now Django knows to include the polls app. Let’s run another command:
python manage.py sql polls

python manage.py syncdb



How to play with the API: python manage.py shell
